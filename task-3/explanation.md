WordPress is extremely flexible and can do many different things. However, at its base, it is a website and blogging platform. You can use it to write a series of posts on your favorite hobby, or just have a one page website about your consulting business. 

When you first install WordPress, you can create blog posts, pages, menus, users, and a few other things. So, out of the box, WordPress gives you all the functionality you need to make a website. 

Plugins is where WordPress gets interesting. Let’s say you buy a kit car, based on a Model-T. It’s going to be very basic when it’s first built. It will get you from point A to point B, but might not have a roof, A/C, or a radio. Adding these features and functions to the car are basically what plugins do. Plugins extend the ability of WordPress to do other things besides content creation. Things like e-commerce, forums, social networks, and just about anything you can imagine. 

Why is this important? With WordPress and plugins, you can build just about anything you can think of. You can make your website or web app truly your own!
