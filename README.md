Below are the solutions and explinations to tasks required to be a Support Star!





## 1. How's Your Code?

Plugin:

1. Displays unique customer ID (random number + append user ID)
2. Shortcode that does something (maybe a high-five button?)
3. A function to use within the theme (maybe simple function that adds a meta box and current mood to blog posts?) Assumes a sidebar, add with metabox.


## 2. And what about your theming?

Two approaches: 

1. All CSS (give CSS to copy and paste)
2. Make plugin to just install (remove title action?)


## 3. Something simple, really?

They ask you what you do, in 200 words or less, explain in the  simplest of ways what WordPress is and why itâ€™s important, also  explain what a plugin is, use at least one analogy that anyone  should be able to understand. 



## 4. Some more style, please!

Two approaches: 

1. All CSS (give CSS to copy and paste)
2. Make plugin to just install
